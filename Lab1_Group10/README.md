# Lab 1: Secure Password Generator
## Objective
The goal of this lab is to create a Python program that generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria such as:
- Total length
- Number of letters
- Number of digits
- Number of special characters
## Program Requirements
### Features
1. **User Input**:
   - Prompt the user for the total length of the password (minimum of 8 characters).
   - Ask for the number of:
     - Letters
     - Digits
     - Special characters
   - Validate inputs to ensure they are logical (e.g., no negative numbers, total length matches criteria).

2. **Password Constraints**:
   - Include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
   - Distribute characters randomly based on user specifications.
   - Handle invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully.
### Code Implementation
- Follow Python best practices:
  - Clear variable and function names.
  - Modular design with functions.
- Include comments explaining key sections of the code.
### Notes
Ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and all functionalities work as expected.
