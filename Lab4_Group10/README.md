# Lab 4: Selenium IDE

## Project Description
This lab involves creating automated tests using Selenium IDE to calculate the body fat percentage for both male and female individuals using the [Calculator.net Body Fat Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/body-fat-calculator.html). We used Selenium IDE's recording functionality and exported the recordings into a Python script, ensuring it executes successfully with necessary adjustments.
