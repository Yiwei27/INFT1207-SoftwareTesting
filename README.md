# Lab 1: Secure Password Generator
## Objective
The goal of this lab is to create a Python program that generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria such as:
- Total length
- Number of letters
- Number of digits
- Number of special characters
## Program Requirements
### Features
1. **User Input**:
   - Prompt the user for the total length of the password (minimum of 8 characters).
   - Ask for the number of:
     - Letters
     - Digits
     - Special characters
   - Validate inputs to ensure they are logical (e.g., no negative numbers, total length matches criteria).

2. **Password Constraints**:
   - Include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
   - Distribute characters randomly based on user specifications.
   - Handle invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully.
### Code Implementation
- Follow Python best practices:
  - Clear variable and function names.
  - Modular design with functions.
- Include comments explaining key sections of the code.
### Notes
Ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and all functionalities work as expected.

# Lab 2: Test Case Design 
## Overview
This project is a Python application that allows users to manage a reading list. Users can add books, retrieve the stored books, search for specific books, and navigate through these options using a text-based menu. The program stores book details in a CSV file.
## Features
- Add books to the reading list (title, author, year).
- Store book details in `books.csv`.
- Retrieve and display all books.
- Search for a specific book by title.
- User-friendly text menu to navigate the functionalities.

### Notes
- The program should follow the course style guide.
- Descriptive variable and function names should be used.
- Exploring additional features beyond the requirements is encouraged.

# Lab 3: Unit Testing
## **Project Overview**  
This project is designed to calculate the areas of four geometric shapes:  
- **Circle**  
- **Trapezium**  
- **Ellipse**  
- **Rhombus**
## **Features**  
- Correctly calculates the area of the four shapes.  
- Includes unit tests with fixtures to verify calculations.  
- Uses a test suite that allows selecting specific shapes for testing.  
- Accepts user input in both uppercase and lowercase.
